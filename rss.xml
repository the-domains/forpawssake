            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About For Paws Sake! Pet Care</h1><p>We are loving, experienced dog walkers, sitters, and companions for your pets while you're at work, out of town, or just need a hand giving your pets the attention they need during your busy day.
We are licensed, bonded and insured and provide the highest quality pet care in the north Seattle neighborhoods. Each visit is customized to meet the needs of your individual pet/s. We understand that all animals are different and we take the time to build a relationship with your pet/s so we can learn how to best adapt to him/her- and not the other way around. We leave a detailed report card after each visit and we even offer to send you selfies of us with your pet/s!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4c92214377f7c094dd095a10ab8f0e155baae6d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
